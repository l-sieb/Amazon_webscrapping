# Project 1 : Webscrapping
**How does the price of a product on a website changed over time ?**
>
The tracking of any information on a page can be done thanks to its html code and Python. This process is called webscrapping.
>
The product used for this example is a [solid schampoo](https://e-benedetti.fr/shampoing-solide-pachamamai-sweetie-demelant-65g.html).
>
While the code is running, you can track the price (or any other information on the page) over time. A CSV file can be generated with all the selected information, and a new line will be added to the file every 24 hours.
